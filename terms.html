        <h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1><br><br>
        <p>Welcome to the Gym and Fitness website (the "Site"). Australian Fitness Supplies, trading as Gym and Fitness ("Gym and Fitness", "GAF", "we", "us", "our"), provides services to you subject to the notices, terms, and conditions outlined in this Agreement (the "Agreement"). In addition, when you use any of our services (e.g., Customer Reviews), you will be subject to the rules, guidelines, policies, terms, and conditions applicable to such service, and they are incorporated into this Agreement by this reference. We reserve the right to change this Site and these terms and conditions at any time.
        </p><br><br>
        <p>ACCESSING, BROWSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE INDICATES YOUR AGREEMENT TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, SO PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE PROCEEDING.
        </p><br><br>
        <h3>PROMOTIONAL OFFERS AND COUPON CODES</h3>
           <p> When redeeming a promotional code, please click the appropriate link to read specific promotion details if required.
            
            These terms and conditions apply to those promotions where you must redeem a promotional code or voucher as part of the offer.
            
            The promotional code is valid for a limited time only.
            Each promotional code can be used only once per person unless otherwise specified.
            The promotional code does not apply to already discounted items.
            The promotional code can not be used with certain financing options unless otherwise stated.
            Promotional codes can not be added after an order is placed.
            Voucher codes can not be redeemed for shipping.
            The promotion is subject to all restrictions outlined in the offer.
            If the promotion has a minimum purchase requirement, taxes and shipping charges do not apply toward the minimum purchase amount.
            Promotional codes are not transferable, may not be resold or redeemed for cash.
            If you return items purchased using a promotional code, we will subtract the value of the promotional code from your return credit.
            Only one promotional code can be used each time and therefore cannot be combined with other offers using a promotional code.
            Gym and Fitness reserves the right to void the transactions where prohibited.
            If you violate any of the Terms and Conditions, the promotion will be invalid, and the promotional code discount will not apply. Gym and Fitness reserves the right to update these terms and conditions without prior notice.
